Shadow_MultiLight — Advanced Multi-Light Shadow Control for Nuke

Overview
Shadow_MultiLight is a production-ready Nuke gizmo built for high-end VFX and CG compositing workflows. It provides layer-by-layer control over CG shadow passes from multiple light sources, letting you art-direct each shadow without the need for costly re-renders.

Key Features

Supports up to 9 individual light shadow passes plus a dedicated contact shadow pass.

Per-light Multiply, Blur, and Mix sliders for precise intensity, softness, and opacity control.

Non-destructive blending for assembling the final shadow composition.

Works seamlessly with multi-light AOVs from render engines like Arnold, V-Ray, Redshift, and others.

Designed for film, TV, commercials, and high-end CG integration where accurate shadow control is crucial.

How It Works
Each shadow pass is isolated via a shuffle operation, adjusted for intensity and softness, and then recombined into the final comp. The contact shadow pass receives its own set of controls for maximum flexibility. The gizmo also allows merging shadows directly over your plate or an existing composite.

Ideal Use Cases

CG creature or character integration into live-action plates.

Product renders with multiple light setups.

Fine-tuning shadows in high-end advertising or cinematic shots.

With Shadow_MultiLight, compositors gain creative freedom to balance and sculpt shadows exactly as the shot demands — all inside Nuke, without going back to 3D.
